Retrieve Users by Id
    - create get function with the parameter id route
    - Create variable to store parsed parameter number 
    - Search through User array to see if there is a match between user ids
            and the body id. 
        - I can use array.find instead of using  a for loop here
        - I can use the nullish coalescing operator 
            to return a string explaining user id does not match records if it fails.
    - Realised I am consistently repeating myself with my response so added and
        object constructor function to make code more DRY.
        - Test in postman
